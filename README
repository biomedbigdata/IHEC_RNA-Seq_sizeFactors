# RNA-Seq Quantification Matrices

These matrices are derived from the gene and transcript files produced by the IHEC reprocessing effort.

## TPM
TPM and pme_TPM values are gathered from the respective column in the RSEM quantification files. 

## Counts
expected_count and posterior_mean_count values are gathered from the respective column in the RSEM quantification files. 
Afterward, the DESeq2 size factor was multiplied per sample to account for library size.

## PCA
Additionally, plots of the dimensionality reductions to the first two principal components are available for each matrix. Note that four samples from the germ line were excluded from that analysis.
